### Assessment 1

* Assessment 1 (worth 30%) is an agent-based model
* The agent-based model can be accessed from <a href="https://github.com/gy19rgm/GEOG5990Assessment1" target="_blank"> gy19rgm's GitHub profile </a>, along with the relevant readme file, licensing and documentation.
* In the model, sheep are herded by sheepdogs, within a 300 unit <sup>2</sup> environment
* The quantity of animals is determined by the user using a slider. The values available are:

| Number of sheep | Number of dogs |
| --- | :---: |
| Between 50 - 100 | Between 5 - 10 |

* Sheep move in a random direction, eating grass and sharing their resources with close by sheep
* If a sheep notices a dog, it moves in the opposite direction at a faster speed to normal
* Dogs move in a random direction at a faster speed to the sheep
* If a dog notices a sheep it halves the distance between itself and the sheep - replicating a 'sprint' and 'stalk'  motion
* Neither sheep or dogs can get past the environment boundary, both are penned in by the 'fence'
